# Webdav Exploit without Metasploit/Meterpreter

These are exploits created to avoid the use of Metasploit. 
While studying for OSCP in the Offsec labs, VHL, Vulnhub, etc, I tried to find ways to limit my use of Metasploit and Meterpreter shells.

The first exploit (webdavrev.py) includes a php reverse shell for Windows [found here](https://github.com/Dhayalanb/windows-php-reverse-shell)

The second exploit (webdavbd.py) only puts a CMD backdoor on the target. This is useful if there are issues with getting a shell.

Do not use these or any of the above referenced exploits on any systems in which you do not have permission to do so.
